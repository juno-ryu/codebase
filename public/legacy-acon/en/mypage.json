        "description1": "“ACON Cash” refers to a new type of gift certificate that members can use to purchase goods. It may be referred to ‘Cash’.",
        "description2": "A member who has charged cash may withdraw the subscription of the use of goods and services within 7 days from the date of payment according to the terms and conditions. If a member does not have history of using the cash charged, the member can request a refund of the total amount of cash charged within 7 days from the date of payment.",
        "description3": "Depending on the payment company’s terms and conditions, it may take up to 5 business days for the card approval to be canceled or the payment to be credited to the member's financial account.",
        "description4": "In addition to the case above, if cash equivalent to or more than 60/100 (80/100 if the remaining cash is less than $10) of the charged cash (the amount charged at the time of cash payment completion) has been used by the member, the member can request for a refund of remaining cash. The refund will take place excluding the refund fee of $1 or 10% of the remaining cash, whichever is greater. Refunds are not possible if the remaining cash is less than $1. However, refund fees will not be deducted if the case is attributable to ACON3D. Members can request refund through 'Inquiries'.",
        "description5": "Refunds will be made within 5 business days to the member's refund account.",
        "description6": "If a member request a cancel or a refund of the cash charged, the company will withdraw the points given for free. If there are no remaining points to be withdrawn, the amount will be deducted from the member's cash refund. ",
        "description7": "Minors must obtain consent from their legal representatives before charging cash. ",
        "description8": "Cash expires at the end of 5 years of the date of cash payment. However, if the member withdraws the membership, the remaining cash will automatically disappear and cannot be recovered. ",
